# Dice-Game-Simulation
The purpose of this program is to simulate a dice gambling game. 
The game is played as follows:
Roll a six-sided die.
If you roll a 1, 2 or a 3, the game is over.
If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then roll again.
With each additional roll, you have the chance to win more money, or you might roll a
game-ending 1, 2, or 3, at which time the game is over, and you keep whatever winnings
you have accumulated.
1. The program is set to run 10,000 simulations of the game and output the following statistics:
the probability that a game ends with a non-zero amount (in percentages),
2. average amount won (in currency format), and
3. the largest amount won (in currency format).
